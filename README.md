# HierPorfolios

This R package is under construction and its first final release is not available on CRAN yet. You can report any bug as an issue.

Three hierarchical portfolio allocation strategies are implemented, namely:

- Hierarchical Risk Parity (De Prado, 2016)
- Hierarchical Clustering-Based Asset Allocation (Raffinot, 2017)
- Hierarchical Equal Risk Controbution (Raffinot, 2018)

Each strategy was implemented in an easy-to-use function: `HRP_Portfolio`, `HACC_Portfolio` and `HERC-Portfolio`.
